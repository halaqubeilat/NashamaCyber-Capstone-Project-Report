# NashamaCyber-Capstone-Project-Report
This repository contains my capstone project developed during Nashama Cyber Bootcamp V9.
The project focuses on vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and mitigation of two critical Linux vulnerabilities:

1-CVE-2023-0386 — OverlayFS Local Privilege Escalation

2-CVE-2023-4911 — Looney Tunables (glibc)

The project includes building vulnerable lab environments, demonstrating exploitation, applying fixes, and verifying mitigation through logging and validation techniques.
